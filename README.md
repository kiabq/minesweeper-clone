# Purpose
This is an app made as I was learning TypeScript. The general design of the game isn't the best, and the code isn't the most efficient, but I had fun while working on it. (Still a W.I.P/Unfinished)

# TODO
- Update pArr8 function
- Add timer
- Add dropdown to select board size (Difficulty)
- (Maybe) Add animations and styling

# Install
- Clone repository into directory of your choice.
- (for package dependencies) ``` npm install ``` in installed  directory.
- From CLI, run ``` npm start ``` in installed directory.
