# Purpose
This is an app made as I was learning TypeScript. The general design of the game isn't the best, and the code isn't the most efficient, but I had fun while working on it. (Still a W.I.P/Unfinished)

# TODO
- Update pArr8 function
- Add flagging
- Add timer
- Add dropdown to select board size (Difficulty)
- (Maybe) Add animations and styling
